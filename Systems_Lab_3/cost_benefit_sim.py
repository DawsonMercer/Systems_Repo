Please see the comments below. 
Caution: This is just a small example/prototype. You are required to
 write the code by following 
instructions/questions given in lab #3.Â 
Lets consider that there are two cost elements and three benefit elements.
It important to understand that number of cost and beenfit elements need not be the same. 
Cost and benefit values are specified in $.
